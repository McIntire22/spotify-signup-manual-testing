# Spotify Signup – Manual QA Testing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents a manual QA testing effort focused on the **Spotify account signup flow**.  
The goal was to validate form behavior, input validation, error handling, boundary conditions, and overall usability during account creation.

Testing was performed from a **quality assurance perspective**, emphasizing both positive (happy path) and negative scenarios to ensure the application handles valid and invalid user input correctly.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Validate signup form functionality with valid user inputs  
- Verify error handling for invalid or missing inputs  
- Test age restriction logic and password requirements  
- Perform boundary testing around critical validation limits  
- Identify usability risks and improvement opportunities

No functional defects were identified during execution of the test cases.  
The signup flow behaved as expected for all tested scenarios.

---

## 💡 Quality Observations
A usability improvement opportunity was identified related to email entry during signup.  
This observation is documented as a **quality improvement**, not a functional defect.
