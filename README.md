Spotify Signup – Manual QA Testing


Project Overview

This project documents a manual QA testing effort focused on the Spotify account signup flow.
The goal was to validate form behavior, input validation, error handling, boundary conditions, and overall usability during account creation.

Testing was performed from a quality assurance perspective, emphasizing both positive (happy path) and negative scenarios to ensure the application handles valid and invalid user input correctly.

Objectives

Validate signup form functionality with valid user inputs

Verify error handling for invalid or missing inputs

Test age restriction logic and password requirements

Perform boundary testing around critical validation limits

Identify usability risks and improvement opportunities

Defects

No functional defects were identified during execution of the test cases.
The signup flow behaved as expected for all tested scenarios.

Quality Observations

A usability improvement opportunity was identified related to email entry during signup.
This observation is documented in the test report as a quality improvement, not a functional defect.

Observations are included for portfolio and learning purposes and do not represent reported defects in the Spotify application.

Key Takeaways

The signup flow demonstrates strong input validation and error handling

Boundary conditions around age and password length are enforced correctly

Negative testing scenarios are handled gracefully

Usability risks can exist even when functionality behaves as designed
